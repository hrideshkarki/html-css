            <h1 style="font-size:50px;">Yam Kumar Karki</h1>
            <p>My name is Yam, and I am originally from Nepal. I came to the United States in 2016 to pursue a degree in software engineering. Unfortunately, I had to drop out of college due to personal reasons. However, I did not let this setback define my career.

                After leaving college, I started working for a broker's firm. Over the past few years, I have gained a wealth of experience in the finance industry. I have developed a strong understanding of how the stock market works and how to help clients make informed investment decisions. </p>
